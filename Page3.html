<p class="poiret">Chameleons are reptiles that are found in Africa, Asia, and parts of Southern Europe and
also has been introduced to North America. Almost half of the world's chameleon species live on the island of Madagascar There are known to be more than 160 species of
the chameleon. The scientific name for the chameleon is Chamaeleonidae. They are know for
their ability to change colors.Chameleons change color to communicate, a response to
temperature, light, mood, and to protect themselves from predators.The chameleon have a
lifespan of 5-9 years. This animal is almost able to see 360-degrees and see two things at
once. The diet for the chameleon are insects, snails, spiders, lizards, birds, flowers,
berries, and fruits.Most chameleons have a prehensile tail that they use to wrap around
tree branches.To catch their prey, they creep along very slowly. Once the prey is in reach,
their suction cup tongue shoots out and sticks to the insect.  Their hands and feet have
large toes that help them cling to branches. Chameleons are loners. In fact, most of the
time females don't want males to even come near them. Small chameleons lay typically 4 to
5 eggs while larger chameleons lay up to 80-100 eggs.</p>
